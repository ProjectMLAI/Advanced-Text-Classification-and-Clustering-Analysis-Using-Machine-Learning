# Advanced-Text-Classification-and-Clustering-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
# Project Overview
This repository details a sophisticated project focused on text classification and clustering using a diverse dataset of Reddit posts, covering topics ranging from gaming to beverage reviews. The project highlights advanced techniques in natural language processing and machine learning to extract meaningful insights from text data.

# Key Features and Methodology
## Data Preprocessingc
Implemented comprehensive preprocessing steps including tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of special characters to refine the dataset for analysis.

## Unique Label Identification
Successfully identified nine unique labels within the dataset, such as “soda”, “tea”, “xbox”, etc., enabling detailed topic-specific analysis.

## Sentiment Analysisc
Executed sentiment analysis on various topics, particularly beverage preferences, to understand public opinion trends and dynamics.

# # Clustering Implementation
Applied K-means clustering algorithm on Tf-IDF vectors, categorizing text data into coherent groups for further analysis.

# # Classifier Development 
Developed and trained multiple classifiers, including logistic regression and SVM, for effective categorization of text data.

# BERT Model Utilization

The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model has been expertly integrated to enhance depth and precision in text classification. This advanced use of BERT enables superior understanding of textual context, significantly elevating accuracy and sophistication in data analysis. Incorporating BERT not only augments the precision of algorithmic outputs but also facilitates more refined, context-aware interpretations of data. The use of this cutting-edge AI technology underscores a commitment to leveraging the latest advancements in natural language processing, setting new standards in data analysis and algorithmic efficiency.
