# Advanced-Text-Classification-and-Clustering-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
# Project Overview
This repository details a sophisticated project focused on text classification and clustering using a diverse dataset of Reddit posts, covering topics ranging from gaming to beverage reviews. The project highlights advanced techniques in natural language processing and machine learning to extract meaningful insights from text data.

# Key Features and Methodology
# # Data Preprocessingc
Implemented comprehensive preprocessing steps including tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of special characters to refine the dataset for analysis.

# # Unique Label Identificationc
Successfully identified nine unique labels within the dataset, such as “soda”, “tea”, “xbox”, etc., enabling detailed topic-specific analysis.

# # Sentiment Analysisc
Executed sentiment analysis on various topics, particularly beverage preferences, to understand public opinion trends and dynamics.

# # Clustering Implementationc
Applied K-means clustering algorithm on Tf-IDF vectors, categorizing text data into coherent groups for further analysis.

# # Classifier Development 
Developed and trained multiple classifiers, including logistic regression and SVM, for effective categorization of text data.

# BERT Model Utilization

Leveraged the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to achieve a deeper contextual understanding and enhanced precision in text classification.

# Applications and Usage
The repository serves as a comprehensive resource for advanced text classification and clustering techniques, useful for researchers and practitioners in the field of data science and machine learning.
Users can explore various methodologies implemented in this project and apply these techniques to other datasets or research areas.
